Lockdown has now been made fun and educational for everyone! With our game, we help kids all over the world learn the precautions of COVID - 19 during lockdown. They are easily able to have fun and enjoy themselves even during this period of crisis as well. 
Our game has 2 levels; 1 for physical health and the other for spiritual and mental health.
Level 1: Use the left and right arrow keys to collect the tennis balls. 1 tennis ball will get you 2 points, and you have to get 20 points to advance to the next level.

Level 2: Use all the arrow keys to control Abby, while she reads books. Touching the books will give you 5 points and you need 40 points to win.

Once you have successfully completed both the levels, you have successfully finished the game. Amidst all this, Abbyâ€™s friend, Avery, explains to her why needs to do this.
